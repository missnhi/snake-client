## Approach

work incrementally, taking small steps and experimenting with our code to better
understand how things work. This is general best practice. Go beyond our
instructions and work incrementally by taking your own smaller steps and even
side steps to better understand a concept
deal with multiple functions and files, and therefore...
add detailed comments within our code, describing our functions and modules in a
concise way constantly keep the maintainability of our project in mind. No extreme
is good. Writing everything in one function or one giant file is typically bad.
So is breaking out the code into too many separate files
strive for a healthy balance of modular code, but that does not mean that it is
an overall ideal solution. We can always do better. We should also take into
account that we're not even two weeks into the course and need to tackle multiple
learning outcomes with this project
keep our code clean by refactoring as we progress instead of deferring major
refactoring work to the end. This is generally good practice, and again,
like with any craft, there is a balancing act here.
